# ML-Project-Language-Detection
In this project, we aim to implement one such application of NLP which is language detection. We use few of the in-built packages off Python such as Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-Learn. Pandas is a Python library used for performing complex data analysis. It provides various functions and methods that can analyze data with ease. NumPy are another Python library that supports complex mathematical computations and array operations. the SkLearn module of Python are special packages that are used for building machine learning models. Few of the 'scikit-learn' functions used in the code are listed below :

 	CountVectorizer() - The CountVectorizer function in the scikit-learn Python module is a text preprocessing tool that converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts. The CountVectorizer function takes a collection of text documents as input and produces a matrix of token counts as output. The matrix of token counts is a sparse matrix, where each row represents a document and each column represents a token. The value in each cell of the matrix represents the number of times the token appears in the document.
  
	fit_transform() - The fit_transform function in the scikit-learn Python module is a two-step process that transforms a dataset into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. The first step, fit, learns the parameters of the transformation from the dataset. The second step, transform, applies the transformation to the dataset.

 	train_test_split() - The train_test_split function takes a dataset as input and produces two datasets as output: the training set and the test set. The training set is a random sample of the dataset, and the test set is the complement of the training set.

  	fit() - The fit function takes a dataset as input and produces a model as output. The model is a representation of the data that can be used to make predictions. 
   
   	score() - The score function takes a model and a dataset as input and produces a score as output. The score is a measure of the performance of the model on the dataset.
